# Roman Numerals

The file <rmn-numerals-workshop.rb> accepts an integer as an arugment and returns the corresponding roman numeral as a string.
The purpose of this repo is to practice stepwise TDD as part of Makers Academy week 1.

### Steps to complete:
1. Create lib and spec folders in your project folder.
2. From your project folder in cmd, type 'rspec --init'
3. Create an RSpec test and begin to write your tests.
4. Run RSpec from cmd line and the test should fail.
5. Iteratively improve your code until the test passes, and all functions of the program pass the tests you've written.
6. After every test you write, run it in RSpec and it should fail. Address this failure in your Roman Numeral code.
